This project is a single-page website that explores the hometowns of Practicum team members from around the world. From the green hills of Kentucky to the historic streets of Kyiv, each section highlights the unique story and visuals of a team memberâ€™s homeland. It was developed using semantic HTML5 and styled with CSS3.
