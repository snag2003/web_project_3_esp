                  Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, is a large city located on the
                  banks of the Dnipro River. Of course, no sane person would
                  swim in the river—unless they grew up here, in which case
                  they’ve probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot here,
                  and winters are windy, but fall and spring are absolutely
                  amazing.

                <p class="place__paragraph">
                  The city itself is a mix of pre-revolutionary, post-war, and
                  Soviet architecture, all peppered with modified balconies. If
                  you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the terrain is hard to
                  navigate by bike or in heels. However, the left bank is
                  considered far less interesting and prestigious—even by people
                  who live on the outskirts of the right bank.

                  The medieval ruin of Criccieth Castle overlooks the town from
                  a rock jutting into the sea. It is believed to have been built
                  by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some 900 years
                  later, the self-proclaimed *Pearl of Wales on the Shores of
                  Snowdonia* has become a popular tourist destination in the
                  summer months.

                  A short walk from the castle, you can enjoy the world’s best
                  ice cream at Cadwalader’s, whose secret ingredient is rumored
                  to be local seaweed. Another claim to fame is that Criccieth
                  won the *Wales in Bloom* award for five years in a row for its
                  spectacular floral displays throughout the town. It was also
                  home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman to serve as the
                  UK’s Prime Minister.

                  Berea is a small town located in central Kentucky. The town is
                  surrounded by beautiful forests and fields. It is known as the
                  state’s arts and crafts capital, and visitors will find plenty
                  of shopping opportunities: handmade jewelry, candles, wooden
                  items, galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds an
                  annual festival celebrating “spoonbread,” a local dish made of
                  cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.

                  However, it is perhaps best known for Berea College, founded

                  college in the southern United States. Uniquely, it does not
                  charge tuition—all students receive a full-tuition

                  Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. During the era
                  of the kingdom, Muramvya was the royal capital, and in 2007,
                  it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List for
                  its culture and natural landscape. It is located in central
                  Burundi, between the country’s political and economic

                  The climate is rather cold at night, but during the day,
                  you’ll feel like you’re in paradise. At 2,665 meters above sea
                  level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the
                  province. But that cool breeze supports one of the country’s
                  largest tea and coffee plantations, which make up the majority
                  of Burundi’s exports.

                  Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves for

                  mountains, ranging from 1,550 to 2,660 meters in elevation. It
                  is filled with lush vegetation and is a source for the many
                  rivers and streams that supply water throughout the country.
